# IAVanillaUI

IAVanillaUI is an ItemsAdder-Add-on that allows you to change the default UI used for displaying Items, crafting recipes, smelting recipes, etc.

The goal was to make the UIs look like vanilla UIs.

## How to use

> **Warning**  
> This add-on overrides the default UIs from ItemsAdder, so make sure to have a back-up in case you want to revert your changes!
