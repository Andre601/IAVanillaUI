# IAVanillaUI

IAVanillaUI is an ItemsAdder-Add-on that allows you to change the default UI used for displaying Items, crafting recipes, smelting recipes, etc.

The goal was to make the UIs look like vanilla UIs.

## How to use

> **Warning**  
> This add-on overrides the default UIs from ItemsAdder, so make sure to have a back-up in case you want to revert your changes!

1. Download the `IAVanillaUI-<version>.zip` file from the [latest release][releases] on this Repository.
2. Open the Zip using either WinRAR or 7Zip.
3. Extract and move `data` into `/plugins/ItemsAdder/`. You may get asked if files should be overriden, which you have to confirm.
4. Re-zip the resource pack using `/iazip`
    - Depending on your hosting solution will you need to update the download URL for the resource pack.
